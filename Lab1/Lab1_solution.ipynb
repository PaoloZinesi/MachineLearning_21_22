    "In this case the training error is approximately constant for every run of the code (after the partitions of the dataset have been fixed), while the same algorithm with only 100 iterations gave very different (and also bigger) training errors for every run of the code. This means that 100 iterations of the perceptron algorithm are not enough to find an optimal solution, while 4000 iterations are sufficient. Most of the times (in the 4000 iteration case) the test error is smaller than the training error, but some partitions of the dataset may led to the other case (test error bigger than the training error)."
